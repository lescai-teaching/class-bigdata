# Exercise 4

## Dataset

A lab is optimising the production of *proteinA* in a bioreactor: they have prepared four different bioreactors with different conditions.
100 samples have been taken from each bioreactor, and the concentration of proteinA has been measured.


You can load the data with the following code:

```R
dataReactor = readRDS(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lescai-teaching/class-bigdata/main/L10_stats_exercises/exercise_04/L10_dataset_exercise04.rds"))
```


## Question

We would like to know if changing the bioreactor always affect the production of proteinA.
